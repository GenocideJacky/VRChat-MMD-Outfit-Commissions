<h1 class="text" id="byb"> Before You Buy</h1>

</div>

</br>

<div class="bigdiv">
<p> I’d like for people to exclusively take note: I make my assets in Blender 2.79. I’m mentioning this now because Blender is completely different from PMX editor, so I cannot confirm if the models I make using it will be completely flawless for MMD. I mostly make assets for VRChat avatars, so that’s what I have the most experience in. </br></br>

In order to keep the model as fitting to the avatar you want it for, I may request an FBX of your model or the base you used, if you used one. This model will ONLY be used for modelling the clothes around. I am not allowed under ANY circumstances to take parts from these models. The base model will then be deleted once I have finished the commission. It is completely optional to provide this, but If declined, I cannot guarantee the asset will completely fit the model and may require further sculpting on the client’s end. Screenshots of the front and side view could also suffice, but cannot guarantee an accurate size. </br></br>

Models can take anywhere from 3 days to a month to be completed. This depends on the complexity of the model and my current home situation. </br></br>

I only model the outfit and you will be sent an FBX/PMX file of only that. This only applies to people who are commissioning me for outfits for already existing models. This does not apply if you own the model/have permission from the original creator to commission an outfit for the model. To find out why I operate like this, please look at my <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>.</br></br>

Please read through all of this document to make sure you completely understand what you are purchasing, and use the handy commission template at the end of the document so I can easily understand what it is you want. </p>

<h1 class="text" id="terms">Terms of Use</h1>
</div>

</br>

<div class="bigdiv">
<p> 
Regarding outfits commissioned, you have the rights to do whatever you want with the asset. It is yours, I don’t own it anymore. However, a little credit would be appreciated! (Not required, but like, tell your friends about me? Please?~)</br></br>

You are allowed to resell the asset if It is being sold on a commissioned/purchasable avatar.</br></br>
Under NO condition are you allowed to resell the asset on its own.</br></br>

As the creator, I have the right to refuse a commission for any reason, even if unspecified. If I, the creator, cancel a commission while half-way through, you as the customer are entitled to a full refund (Not including PayPal currency tax/DeviantArt charges, i have no control or access to that.) no matter how far I got before I cancelled, but this also means you are not entitled to the half-complete models.</br></br>

I am allowed, as the creator, to use commissioned pieces as commission examples. This will only include screenshots and nothing more.</p>

<p>Robotic limbs.</br></br>Animal/Neko parts.</br></br>Gloves.</br></br>Shoes</p>

<p>Please don't be discouraged, though! I can still accept commissions that include these items, just please be aware that I am not especially practiced at these and the quality of the items can vary.

<h2 class="text"> What I Will NOT Model</h2>

<p>Genitalia of either sex.</br></br>Items of clothing/outfits with transphobic, homophobic, racist, sexist or otherwise offensive imagery/text.</br></br>Items of clothing.outfits with depictions of nudity, drawn or real.</p>

<h1 class="text" id="payment">Payment</h1>
</div>

</br>

<div class="bigdiv">

<p> I accept PayPal payment in USD (Dollars) and GBP (Pounds). Please use the corresponding currency labelled as the PayPal currency exchange rate has already been pre-calculated.</br></br> I only accept payment upfront and will not start until I have recieved payment.</br></br>
I also accept payment in DA's points but this is not recommended as I will have to charge you for DA's non-core member charge. Apologies for this.</br></br>
Also, for those paying in points, please wait until I've set up a Commission Widget with the price. This allows me to still get paid in actual currency as DeviantArt converts it. I will not accept points given any other way.</p>

<h1 class="text" id="prices">Prices</h1>
</div>

</br>

<div class="bigdiv">

<h2 class="text" id="singlepiece">Single Clothing Pieces</h2>
<h4 class="text"> <i>This counts as shirts, jackets, pants, etc.</i></h4>


</br>

<h4 class="text">$13</h4>
<h4 class="text">£10</h4>
<h4 class="text">1300 DA Points</h4>

<p> NOTE: If you're ordering a jacket with a shirt underneath, this will cost the price of one clothing piece PLUS half the price of a clothing piece. Basically like one and a half shirts. ($19.50/£15/1950 DA Points) This is the same deal when ordering dresses! (THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE BALL-GOWNS/POOFY DRESSES! THOSE WILL COST DOUBLE! ($26/£20/2600 DA Points)</p>



</br>

<h2 class="text" id="singleaccessory">Single Accessory</h2>
<h4 class="text"> <i>This counts as jewellery, hats, bags, shoes, etc.</i></h4>

</br>

<h4 class="text">$20</h4>
<h4 class="text">£15</h4>
<h4 class="text">2000 DA Points</h4>

<p> NOTE: Horns, glasses, beanies, sandals, eyepatches, piercings and other simpler accessories also count but are half the price.</p>

</br>

<h2 class="text" id="outfits">What About a Full Outfit?</h2>

<p>Full outfits are calculated by adding up all the parts of the outfit and then taking 10% off the end price. For example, if a full outfit consisted of a shirt, pants, shoes and a necklace, the price would come to  £45/$59.40 5940 DeviantArt Points.</p>

</br>

<h2 class="text" id="addbones">Adding Dynamic Bones</h2>

<p>Models do not come with dynamic bones by default. (Sorry!) Please let me know if you'd like the model to come with dynamic bones BEFORE I start modelling! It makes things easier for me.</p>
</br>

<h3 class="text">Skirt/Dress Bones</h3>
<h4 class="text"> <i>This is an addtional charge for adding bones in the skirts/dresses so that they flow and move. This is completely optional and entirely up to you.</i></h4>

</br>

<h4 class="text">+$13</h4>
<h4 class="text">+£10</h4>
<h4 class="text">+1300 DA Points</h4>

<p> NOTES: By default, models will come without bones in the skirts, ribbons, etc. anything that should move, basically. If you were to commission a skirt with no dynamic bones, I’d weight paint the skirt to the legs instead. (This means that the skirt will move with the legs, but will not have any physics of its own.) </br></br>

By adding dynamic bones, you’ll need to point out what you want to move around in the model. Please mention what you want to move BEFORE I start the modelling process! It makes it a lot more efficient!</br></br>

<b>NOTE FOR MMD USERS:</b> I can add the bones, but I have no clue as to how rigid bodies and joints and all that works. You will unfortunately need to do that yourself. VRChat users are fine though and will not have to worry about any Dynamic Bone issues!
</p>

<h3 class="text">Other Bones</h3>
<h4 class="text"> <i>This is an additional charge adding bones to sleeves, jewellery or anything else you'd like to move on the model. This is completely optional and up to you.</i></h4>

<h4 class="text">+$7</h4>
<h4 class="text">+£5</h4>
<h4 class="text">+700 DA Points</h4>

</br>

<h3 class="text">Complicated Designs</h3>
<h4 class="text"> <i>This is for if I deem the design to be complicated to make. This is an additional charge added onto the original price.</i></h4>

<h4 class="text">+$7</h4>
<h4 class="text">+£5</h4>
<h4 class="text">+700 DA Points</h4>

<p>A way to make the commission process simpler is by sending me this commission template! That way we can get right into business and waste less time discussing.</p>


<div>
<h2 class="text">
------------------------------------------</br>
Hi! I’d like a model commission!</br>
</br>
Username:</br>
Currency:</br>
Type of commission:</br>
Use for MMD or VRChat?:</br>
Dynamic Bones?:</br>
My Avatar Gender:</br>
Clothing Image/Word Reference:</br>
Any additional information:</br>
(Attachment of avatar, base, or isometric front and side screenshots of avatar)</br>
------------------------------------------ </h2>
</div>

<p>Once I have received the template, I will calculate the price and confirm it with you.</br></br>
If you’re feeling a little lost, let’s fill this out together!</p>

<div>
<h1 class="text">Username:</h1>
<p>Basic step, I know, but it really helps with organizing commissions!</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1 class="text">Currency:</h1>
<p>Which currency you’ll be paying in. (Your choices are Dollars($), Pounds(£) and DeviantArt Points.) This is to make calculating the final price a bit easier.</br></br>
<b>(If your currency is not listed, I will be unable to take your commission. Sorry!)</b></p>
</div>

<div>
<h1 class="text">Type of Commission:</h1>
<p>This is asking what you were expecting the commission to be. The choices are:</p>
<ul>
<li class="text">Clothing Piece</li>
<li class="text">Accessory</li>
<li class="text">Full Outfit</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are asking for multiple pieces of clothing in the same commission but don't think it classifies as a full outfit (eg 2/3 pieces), feel free to send the commission template multiple times, each filled in with the correct references, etc.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1 class="text">Use for MMD or VRChat?:<h1>
<p>Not only will this be for which format I export to, but if you chose MMD, this will also prompt me to confirm that you are aware that I use Blender and cannot guarantee perfection for use in MMD. You’ll need to confirm that you understand this.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1 class="text">Dynamic Bones?:</h1>
<p>A simple yes/no will do, but if you want to, you can have a basic description of what you want to move on the model. </p>

<p>MMD USER NOTE: Please remember that MMD models will come with bones in the skirts or flowy parts if you say yes to this, but I have NO idea how to make rigid bodies or joints work using blender (the things that make MMD hair and skirts flowy) and I do not know how to use PMX editor in the slightest! These bones will be useless to you unless you know how to work rigid bodies and joints in PMX editor or you plan on animating all the physics yourself, bone by bone!</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1 class="text">My Avatar Gender:</h1>
<p>This is just to make sure I have the correct body type, ESPECIALLY if I’m not provided a 3D avatar to mould around. This can be as simple as “Female” to as complicated as “Genderfluid” or “Non-binary, feminine aligned.” Just put your avatar’s gender, and if I need further details, I will inquire.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1 class="text">Clothing Image/Word Reference:</h1>
<p>This can be either a single image of a full outfit where you point out what you want, or can be multiple images of different pieces of clothing that you have pieced together to get the desired outfit.</br></br>
If you have no images, you may describe the outfit, but I will require detail. Ex. “I want a pink crop top that reaches just above the belly button with a v-neck. I want the pink to tapor into a white gradient near the bottom…” etc. This may require more back and forth and more frequent updates, but that’s only because I want it to be perfect for you.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1 class="text">Any Additional Information:</h1>
<p>This is for the little details you need to add like additional accessories, a change in colour or special requests.</p>
</div>

<div>
<h1 class="text">Attachments:</h1>
<p>If you could attach a Sta.sh link or google drive link to your avatar, preferably without clothing, but if you only have it with clothing, I can make that work too. If you don’t feel comfortable sending the avatar file, that is perfectly alright! Instead, I’ll need 2 isometric screenshots of the avatar with/without clothing. One of the front straight on and the other of the side view. If the avatar has nudity, please censor this before sending the screenshots, thank you!</br></br>
If you don’t feel comfortable sending either of these, that’s fine too! I will try and base a Vroid model around the gender you listed and model around that instead, but I cannot confirm if this will fit your avatar once it is completed.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="text">Understand? Here’s a basic example to wrap things up!</h2>

<h3 class="text">

<h1 class="text" id="faq">FAQ</h1>
</div>

</br>

<div class="bigdiv">

<h2 class="text"> Q: Why can't you just put the outfit on the model and send me that? It's not that hard.</h2>
<h3 class="text"> A: Once again, <b>This only applies to people who do not own the model they're commissioning an outfit for.</b> The reason why I will not send the outfit and model in the same file is because I do not feel morally right doing so. I am not here to make money off of other people's models. What people do with my outfits and who they put them on is entirely their business and not mine. If you want someone to put the outfit on the model for use in VRChat/MMD, then please either learn how or ask someone else. Thank you for understanding.</h3>

<h2 class="text">Q: Can you make a recolour of this model for me?</h2>
<h3 class="text">A: This also pertains to the first question. Recoloring someone else's model and asking for compensation is making money off of someone else's work and I shall not do so, nor do I condone doing so. However, if you have proof that you own the model or proof that you have permission, I may be able to do it for you.</h3>

<h2 class="text">Q: I don't have the money right now, but I'll have it later! Can you still take my commission?</h2>
<h3 class="text">No. This may seem harsh, but not accepting payment first thing makes me vulnerable to people who may attempt to scam me out of my time and work.</h3>

<h2 class="text">Q: Can you also model things for VRoid?</h2>
<h3 class="text">A: Yes. Not only that, if you have made the VRoid model yourself, I am more than happy to send you the model with the outfit already on instead of just sending the outfit, as I know for sure that you already own the model. (Also, no promises, but I may also be able to give you the file in .VRM or .vroid file formats, if I figure out how.)</h3>
